- 👋 Hi, I’m @rjbbrooks.  I'm not a programmer; just an IT generalist, and have worked in IT support since the late 1990s.
- 👀 I’m interested in Microsoft Intune, specifically zero-touch provisoning of Windows and MacOS desktops in a nonprofit environment using just the out of the box tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently preparing for Microsoft's MD-100 and MD-101 exams.  The last time I wrote a Microsoft exam was in 1999.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... hmmm, let me get back to you on that.
- 📫 How to reach me by email at rjbbrooks@outlook.com
